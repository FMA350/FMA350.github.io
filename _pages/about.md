<p>Hi, my name is Francesco. I love discovering the universe, exploring our planet,
and learning more about the history and cultures that surround us. 
</p>
<p>
Professionally, I am a software engineer and my tool of choice is C++. At the moment, I am working in the FinTech industry
and I am thoroughly enjoying the process of discovering the intricacies of this fascinating sector.
<i>I like to solve complex problems with elegant solutions</i>.<br></p>
<p>
Welcome to my website and blog. I hope that exploring it will be as much fun as I had making it.
