Profiling is a very important activity for any self respecting software developer, as it can help identify bottlenecks, undesired behaviors, and leaks. But too few in the industry take the time to learn how to use profilers effectively, if at all! Let's change that by profiling our first C++ application with [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)

## A profiler to rule them all

While there are many profilers out there, I decided to use Valgrind due to its modular nature, pervasiveness, and open sourceness. It's easy to install, usually requiring a single command from your favorite package manager:

> ~\> apt install valgrind <br>
> ~\> valgrind --version

Next, we need an application to profile. Grab your favorite IDE or text editor and let's writing!

```c++
