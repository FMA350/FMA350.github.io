Amongst the additions and innovations that c++17 brought about, std::any is certainly a powerful one.
A while back I decided to leverage the class to create a powerful construct: a map of any.


## Requirements

The requirements for the exercise could be expressed by the following:

1. The class had to be able to store any types: int, double, char[], std::string, user defined classes and so on.
2. The class had to be able to store N values in subsections of depth D, with N and D defined at runtime.
3. The class had to preserve the interface of a c++ map. In fact, a C++ map could be thought as a special case of the generic map.

Feel free to try to code this class yourself. It is a fun exercise, I assure you.

## False starts

> Variants cannot hold vectors, nor maps, nor class rerences, nor void * pointers from hell.

When I began coding a solution for this exercise, I stumbled upon a few false starts.

Initially, I was hoping I could resolve the exercise with variadic templates. Indeed, templates make for an elegant solution when we intend to use a class or function that holds the same functionality with a variety of types. But they are not magic: the compiler simply creates the specialized code for each class or function at compile time. A map of strings and T can only contain one type T, whatever T might be.
Additionally, we are required to define the depth of our class at compile time as well (a breach of the second requirement).

I then attempted to use another c++17 innovation: variants. Variants are special structures similar to unions (but bettert and safer). A variant can contain any type of primitives. A map of variants would thus help with the first requirement, allowing us to store ints and alongside strings for instance. But again, they would fail miserably with the second requirement. Variants cannot hold vectors, nor maps, nor class references, nor void * pointers from hell.


## std::any comes to the rescue

Enter std::any, a class that allows safe type-casting and can store <s> any type </s>.
