Amongst the additions and innovations that c++17 brought about, std::any is certainly a powerful one.
A while back I decided to leverage the class to create a powerful construct: a map of any.


## Requirements

The requirements for the exercise could be expressed by the following:

1. The class had to be able to store any types: int, double, char[], std::string, user defined classes and so on.
2. The class had to be able to store N values in subsections of depth D, with N and D defined at runtime.
3. The class had to preserve the interface of a c++ map. In fact, a C++ map could be thought as a special case of the generic map.

Feel free to try to code this class yourself. It is a fun exercise, I assure you.

## False starts

There were a few false starts when
